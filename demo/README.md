This is a demonstration of the WireMock State Extension, showcasing its initial feature set and usage examples.

## General Overview

- **Watch the Demo Video**: [WireMock State Extension Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUrMEpzHbvY)
- **View the Slides**: [WireMock State Extension Slides](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock-state-extension/blob/develop/demo/wiremock_state_extension_webinar.pdf)

## Initial Feature Set: The State

- Creating, updating, and deleting a state.
- Storing different states in association with a context.
- Request matcher to check for the existence of a context.
- Handlebars support.

## State

A context can have multiple properties. Each property can be overwritten individually.

### Context

The parent container of a state. Multiple contexts can exist.

### Example: Modeling Queues

- Adding new (unmodifiable) states to the context.
- Insert as the first or last item.
- Read access to the first/last/index.
- Delete first/last/index.
- Check size.
- Suggested by @ioanngolovko.

### StateList

### Example: Improving Usability

- Allow defining default values (suggested by @alexandre-chopin).
- Expose the "list" to Handlebars.
- Allow building listing endpoints.
- Query "special" properties: updateCount, listSize, list, property existence.
- Delete single properties.
- Loadable in WireMock standalone and Docker container.
